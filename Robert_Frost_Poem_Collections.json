He spoke\r\nAdvancing toward her: \"What is it you see\r\nFrom up there always for I want to know.\"\r\nShe turned and sank upon her skirts at that,\r\nAnd her face changed from terrified to dull.\r\nHe said to gain time: \"What is it you see?\"\r\nMounting until she cowered under him.\r\n\"I will find out now you must tell me, dear.\"\r\nShe, in her place, refused him any help\r\nWith the least stiffening of her neck and silence.\r\nShe let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,\r\nBlind creature; and a while he didn't see.\r\nBut at last he murmured, \"Oh,\" and again, \"Oh.\"\n\r\n\"What is it what?\" she said.\n\"Just that I see.\"\n\r\n\"You don't,\" she challenged. \"Tell me what it is.\"\n\r\n\"The wonder is I didn't see at once.\r\nI never noticed it from here before.\r\nI must be wonted to it that's the reason.\r\nThe little graveyard where my people are!\r\nSo small the window frames the whole of it.\r\nNot so much larger than a bedroom, is it?\r\nThere are three stones of slate and one of marble,\r\nBroad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight\r\nOn the sidehill. We haven't to mind those.\r\nBut I understand: it is not the stones,\r\nBut the child's mound  \"\n\n\"Don't, don't, don't, don't,\" she cried.\n\r\nShe withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm\r\nThat rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;\r\nAnd turned on him with such a daunting look,\r\nHe said twice over before he knew himself:\r\n\"Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?\"\n\r\n\"Not you!

We could have some\narrangement\r\nBy which I'd bind myself to keep hands off\r\nAnything special you're a-mind to name.\r\nThough I don't like such things 'twixt those that\nlove.\r\nTwo that don't love can't live together without\nthem.\r\nBut two that do can't live together with them.\"\r\nShe moved the latch a little. \"Don't don't go.\r\nDon't carry it to someone else this time.\r\nTell me about it if it's something human.\r\nLet me into your grief.

I didn't know you.\r\nAnd I crept down the stairs and up the stairs\r\nTo look again, and still your spade kept lifting.\r\nThen you came in. I heard your rumbling voice\r\nOut in the kitchen, and I don't know why,\r\nBut I went near to see with my own eyes.\r\nYou could sit there with the stains on your shoes\r\nOf the fresh earth from your own baby's grave\r\nAnd talk about your everyday concerns.\r\nYou had stood the spade up against the wall\r\nOutside there in the entry, for I saw it.\"\n\r\n\"I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.\r\nI'm cursed.

When she heard his step,\r\nShe ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage\r\nTo meet him in the doorway with the news\r\nAnd put him on his guard. \"Silas is back.\"\n\r\nShe pushed him outward with her through the door\r\nAnd shut it after her. \"Be kind,\" she said.\r\nShe took the market things from Warren's arms\r\nAnd set them on the porch, then drew him down\r\nTo sit beside her on the wooden steps.\n\r\n\"When was I ever anything but kind to him?\r\nBut I'll not have the fellow back,\" he said.\r\n\"I told him so last haying, didn't I?\r\n'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'\r\nWhat good is he? Who else will harbour him\r\nAt his age for the little he can do?\r\nWhat help he is there's no depending on.\r\nOff he goes always when I need him most.\n\r\n'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,\r\nEnough at least to buy tobacco with,\r\nSo he won't have to beg and be beholden.'\r\n'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay\r\nAny fixed wages, though I wish I could.'\r\n'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have\nto.'\r\nI shouldn't mind his bettering himself\r\nIf that was what it was. You can be certain,\r\nWhen he begins like that, there's someone at him\r\nTrying to coax him off with pocket-money, \r\nIn haying time, when any help is scarce.\r\nIn winter he comes back to us. I'm done.\"\n\r\n\"Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you,\" Mary said.\n\r\n\"I want him to: he'll have to soon or late.\"\n\r\n\"He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.\r\nWhen I came up from Rowe's I found him here,\r\nHuddled against the barn-door fast asleep,\r\nA miserable sight, and frightening, too \r\nYou needn't smile I didn't recognise him \r\nI wasn't looking for him and he's changed.\r\nWait till you see.\"\n\n\"Where did you say he'd been?\"\n\r\n\"He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,\r\nAnd gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.\r\nI tried to make him talk about his travels.\r\nNothing would do: he just kept nodding off.\"\n\r\n\"What did he say? Did he say anything?\"\n\r\n\"But little.\"\n\n\"Anything? Mary, confess\r\nHe said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me.\"\n\r\n\"Warren!\"\n\n\"But did he? I just want to know.\"\n\r\n\"Of course he did. What would you have him say?\r\nSurely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man\r\nSome humble way to save his self-respect.\r\nHe added, if you really care to know,\r\nHe meant to clear the upper pasture, too.\r\nThat sounds like something you have heard before?\r\nWarren, I wish you could have heard the way\r\nHe jumbled everything. I stopped to look\r\nTwo or three times he made me feel so queer \r\nTo see if he was talking in his sleep.\r\nHe ran on Harold Wilson you remember \r\nThe boy you had in haying four years since.\r\nHe's finished school, and teaching in his college.\r\nSilas declares you'll have to get him back.\r\nHe says they two will make a team for work:\r\nBetween them they will lay this farm as smooth!\r\nThe way he mixed that in with other things.\r\nHe thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft\r\nOn education you know how they fought\r\nAll through July under the blazing sun,\r\nSilas up on the cart to build the load,\r\nHarold along beside to pitch it on.\"\n\r\n\"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.\"\n\r\n\"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.\r\nYou wouldn't think they would. How some things\nlinger!\r\nHarold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.\r\nAfter so many years he still keeps finding\r\nGood arguments he sees he might have used.\r\nI sympathise. I know just how it feels\r\nTo think of the right thing to say too late.\r\nHarold's associated in his mind with Latin.\r\nHe asked me what I thought of Harold's saying\r\nHe studied Latin like the violin\r\nBecause he liked it that an argument!\r\nHe said he couldn't make the boy believe\r\nHe could find water with a hazel prong \r\nWhich showed how much good school had ever done\nhim.\r\nHe wanted to go over that. But most of all\r\nHe thinks if he could have another chance\r\nTo teach him how to build a load of hay  \"\n\r\n\"I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.\r\nHe bundles every forkful in its place,\r\nAnd tags and numbers it for future reference,\r\nSo he can find and easily dislodge it\r\nIn the unloading. Silas does that well.\r\nHe takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.\r\nYou never see him standing on the hay\r\nHe's trying to lift, straining to lift himself.\"\n\r\n\"He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be\r\nSome good perhaps to someone in the world.\r\nHe hates to see a boy the fool of books.\r\nPoor Silas, so concerned for other folk,\r\nAnd nothing to look backward to with pride,\r\nAnd nothing to look forward to with hope,\r\nSo now and never any different.\"\n\r\nPart of a moon was falling down the west,\r\nDragging the whole sky with it to the hills.\r\nIts light poured softly in her lap. She saw\r\nAnd spread her apron to it. She put out her hand\r\nAmong the harp-like morning-glory strings,\r\nTaut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,\r\nAs if she played unheard the tenderness\r\nThat wrought on him beside her in the night.\r\n\"Warren,\" she said, \"he has come home to die:\r\nYou needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time.\"\n\r\n\"Home,\" he mocked gently.\n\n\"Yes, what else but home?\n\r\nIt all depends on what you mean by home.\r\nOf course he's nothing to us, any more\r\nThan was the hound that came a stranger to us\r\nOut of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\"\n\r\n\"Home is the place where, when you have to go\nthere,\r\nThey have to take you in.\"\n\n\"I should have called it\r\nSomething you somehow haven't to deserve.\"\n\r\nWarren leaned out and took a step or two,\r\nPicked up a little stick, and brought it back\r\nAnd broke it in his hand and tossed it by.\r\n\"Silas has better claim on us, you think,\r\nThan on his brother? Thirteen little miles\r\nAs the road winds would bring him to his door.\r\nSilas has walked that far no doubt to-day.\r\nWhy didn't he go there? His brother's rich,\r\nA somebody director in the bank.\"\n\r\n\"He never told us that.\"\n\n\"We know it though.\"\n\r\n\"I think his brother ought to help, of course.\r\nI'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right\r\nTo take him in, and might be willing to \r\nHe may be better than appearances.\r\nBut have some pity on Silas. Do you think\r\nIf he'd had any pride in claiming kin\r\nOr anything he looked for from his brother,\r\nHe'd keep so still about him all this time?\"\n\r\n\"I wonder what's between them.\"\n\n\"I can tell you.\r\nSilas is what he is we wouldn't mind him \r\nBut just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.\r\nHe never did a thing so very bad.\r\nHe don't know why he isn't quite as good\r\nAs anyone. He won't be made ashamed\r\nTo please his brother, worthless though he is.\"\n\r\n\"I can't think Si ever hurt anyone.\"\n\r\n\"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay\r\nAnd rolled his old head on that sharp-edged\nchair-back.\r\nHe wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.\r\nYou must go in and see what you can do.\r\nI made the bed up for him there to-night.\r\nYou'll be surprised at him how much he's broken.\r\nHis working days are done; I'm sure of it.\"\n\r\n\"I'd not be in a hurry to say that.\"\n\r\n\"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.\r\nBut, Warren, please remember how it is:\r\nHe's come to help you ditch the meadow.\r\nHe has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.\r\nHe may not speak of it, and then he may.\r\nI'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud\r\nWill hit or miss the moon.\"\n\nIt hit the moon.\r\nThen there were three there, making a dim row,\r\nThe moon, the little silver cloud, and she.\n\r\nWarren returned too soon, it seemed to her,\r\nSlipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.\n\r\n\"Warren,\" she questioned.\n\n\"Dead,\" was all he answered."

It seems to me\r\nI can't express my feelings any more\r\nThan I can raise my voice or want to lift\r\nMy hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).\r\nDid ever you feel so? I hope you never.\r\nIt's got so I don't even know for sure\r\nWhether I am glad, sorry, or anything.\r\nThere's nothing but a voice-like left inside\r\nThat seems to tell me how I ought to feel,\r\nAnd would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.\r\nYou take the lake. I look and look at it.\r\nI see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.\r\nI stand and make myself repeat out loud\r\nThe advantages it has, so long and narrow,\r\nLike a deep piece of some old running river\r\nCut short off at both ends. It lies five miles\r\nStraight away through the mountain notch\r\nFrom the sink window where I wash the plates,\r\nAnd all our storms come up toward the house,\r\nDrawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and\nwhiter.\r\nIt took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit\r\nTo step outdoors and take the water dazzle\r\nA sunny morning, or take the rising wind\r\nAbout my face and body and through my wrapper,\r\nWhen a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,\r\nAnd a cold chill shivered across the lake.\r\nI see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,\r\nOur Willoughby! How did you hear of it?\r\nI expect, though, everyone's heard of it.\r\nIn a book about ferns? Listen to that!\r\nYou let things more like feathers regulate\r\nYour going and coming. And you like it here?\r\nI can see how you might. But I don't know!\r\nIt would be different if more people came,\r\nFor then there would be business. As it is,\r\nThe cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\r\nSometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore\r\nThat ought to be worth something, and may yet.\r\nBut I don't count on it as much as Len.\r\nHe looks on the bright side of everything,\r\nIncluding me. He thinks I'll be all right\r\nWith doctoring. But it's not medicine \r\nLowe is the only doctor's dared to say so \r\nIt's rest I want there, I have said it out \r\nFrom cooking meals for hungry hired men\r\nAnd washing dishes after them from doing\r\nThings over and over that just won't stay done.\r\nBy good rights I ought not to have so much\r\nPut on me, but there seems no other way.\r\nLen says one steady pull more ought to do it.\r\nHe says the best way out is always through.\r\nAnd I agree to that, or in so far\r\nAs that I can see no way out but through \r\nLeastways for me and then they'll be convinced.\r\nIt's not that Len don't want the best for me.\r\nIt was his plan our moving over in\r\nBeside the lake from where that day I showed you\r\nWe used to live ten miles from anywhere\r\nWe didn't change without some sacrifice,\r\nBut Len went at it to make up the loss.\r\nHis work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,\r\nBut he works when he works as hard as I do \r\nThough there's small profit in comparisons.\r\n(Women and men will make them all the same.)\r\nBut work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.\r\nHe's into everything in town. This year\r\nIt's highways, and he's got too many men\r\nAround him to look after that make waste.\r\nThey take advantage of him shamefully,\r\nAnd proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\r\nWe have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\r\nSprawling about the kitchen with their talk\r\nWhile I fry their bacon. Much they care!\r\nNo more put out in what they do or say\r\nThan if I wasn't in the room at all.\r\nComing and going all the time, they are:\r\nI don't learn what their names are, let alone\r\nTheir characters, or whether they are safe\r\nTo have inside the house with doors unlocked.\r\nI'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not\r\nAfraid of me. There's two can play at that.\r\nI have my fancies: it runs in the family.\r\nMy father's brother wasn't right. They kept him\r\nLocked up for years back there at the old farm.\r\nI've been away once yes, I've been away.\r\nThe State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\r\nI wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;\r\nYou know the old idea the only asylum\r\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\r\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\r\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\r\nBut it's not so: the place is the asylum.\r\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\r\nAnd you aren't darkening other people's lives \r\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\r\nTo you in your condition; you can't know\r\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\r\nI've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\r\nMy father's brother, he went mad quite young.\r\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\r\nBecause his violence took on the form\r\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\r\nBut it's more likely he was crossed in love,\r\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\r\nAnyway, all he talked about was love.\r\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\r\nIf he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended\r\nIn father's building him a sort of cage,\r\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\r\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling, \r\nA narrow passage all the way around.\r\nAnything they put in for furniture\r\nHe'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\r\nSo they made the place comfortable with straw,\r\nLike a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.\r\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\r\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\r\nWith his clothes on his arm all of his clothes.\r\nCruel it sounds. I s'pose they did the best\r\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\r\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\r\nA bride, to help take care of such a creature,\r\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\r\nThat was what marrying father meant to her.\r\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\r\nBy his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout\r\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\r\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\r\nHe'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\r\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\r\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\r\nAnd then he'd crow as if he thought that child's\nplay \r\nThe only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,\r\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\r\nHe was before my time I never saw him;\r\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\r\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\r\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\r\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\r\nIt got so I would say you know, half fooling \r\n\"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail\" \r\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\r\nNo wonder I was glad to get away.\r\nMind you, I waited till Len said the word.\r\nI didn't want the blame if things went wrong.\r\nI was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\r\nAnd I looked to be happy, and I was,\r\nAs I said, for a while but I don't know!\r\nSomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\r\nAnd there's more to it than just window-views\r\nAnd living by a lake. I'm past such help \r\nUnless Len took the notion, which he won't,\r\nAnd I won't ask him it's not sure enough.\r\nI 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:\r\nOther folks have to, and why shouldn't I?\r\nI almost think if I could do like you,\r\nDrop everything and live out on the ground \r\nBut it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,\r\nOr a long rain. I should soon get enough,\r\nAnd be glad of a good roof overhead.\r\nI've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,\r\nMore than you have yourself, some of these nights.\r\nThe wonder was the tents weren't snatched away\r\nFrom over you as you lay in your beds.\r\nI haven't courage for a risk like that.\r\nBless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,\r\nBut the thing of it is, I need to be kept.\r\nThere's work enough to do there's always that;\r\nBut behind's behind. The worst that you can do\r\nIs set me back a little more behind.\r\nI shan't catch up in this world, anyway.\r\nI'd rather you'd not go unless you must."

When's he coming?\"\n\r\n\"I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose\r\nTo try to help me drive a better bargain.\"\n\r\n\"Well, if it's true! Yours are no common feet.\r\nThe lawyer don't know what it is he's buying:\r\nSo many miles you might have walked you won't\nwalk.\r\nYou haven't run your forty orchids down.\r\nWhat does he think? How are the blessed feet?\r\nThe doctor's sure you're going to walk again?\"\n\r\n\"He thinks I'll hobble.

Why didn't they throw off the belt\r\nInstead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?\"\n\r\n\"They say sometime was wasted on the belt \r\nOld streak of leather doesn't love me much\r\nBecause I made him spit fire at my knuckles,\r\nThe way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.\r\nThat must be it.

I have to take\r\nWhat I can get. You see they have the feet,\r\nWhich gives them the advantage in the trade.\r\nI can't get back the feet in any case.\"\n\r\n\"But your flowers, man, you're selling out your\nflowers.\"\n\r\n\"Yes, that's one way to put it all the flowers\r\nOf every kind everywhere in this region\r\nFor the next forty summers call it forty.\r\nBut I'm not selling those, I'm giving them,\r\nThey never earned me so much as one cent:\r\nMoney can't pay me for the loss of them.\r\nNo, the five hundred was the sum they named\r\nTo pay the doctor's bill and tide me over.\r\nIt's that or fight, and I don't want to fight \r\nI just want to get settled in my life,\r\nSuch as it's going to be, and know the worst,\r\nOr best it may not be so bad. The firm\r\nPromise me all the shooks I want to nail.\"\n\r\n\"But what about your flora of the valley?\"\n\r\n\"You have me there. But that you didn't think\r\nThat was worth money to me?

I'm tired.\"\n\r\nWillis brought up besides the Boston lawyer\r\nA little barefoot girl who in the noise\r\nOf heavy footsteps in the old frame house,\r\nAnd baritone importance of the lawyer,\r\nStood for a while unnoticed with her hands\r\nShyly behind her.\n\n\"Well, and how is Mister \"\r\nThe lawyer was already in his satchel\r\nAs if for papers that might bear the name\r\nHe hadn't at command. \"You must excuse me,\r\nI dropped in at the mill and was detained.\"\n\r\n\"Looking round, I suppose,\" said Willis.\n\n\"Yes,\r\nWell, yes.\"\n\n\"Hear anything that might prove useful?\"\n\r\nThe Broken One saw Anne. \"Why, here is Anne\r\nWhat do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed;\r\nTell me what is it?\" Anne just wagged her dress\r\nWith both hands held behind her. \"Guess,\" she\nsaid.\n\r\n\"Oh, guess which hand? My, my! Once on a\ntime\r\nI knew a lovely way to tell for certain\r\nBy looking in the ears. But I forget it.\r\nEr, let me see. I think I'll take the right.\r\nThat's sure to be right even if it's wrong.\r\nCome, hold it out. Don't change. A Ram's Horn\norchid!\r\nA Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder,\r\nIf I had chosen left. Hold out the left.\r\nAnother Ram's Horn! Where did you find those,\r\nUnder what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?\"\n\r\nAnne looked at the large lawyer at her side,\r\nAnd thought she wouldn't venture on so much.\n\r\n\"Were there no others?\"\n\n\"There were four or five.\r\nI knew you wouldn't let me pick them all.\"\n\r\n\"I wouldn't so I wouldn't. You're the girl!\r\nYou see Anne has her lesson learned by heart.\"\n\r\n\"I wanted there should be some there next year.\"\n\r\n\"Of course you did. You left the rest for seed,\r\nAnd for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl!\r\nA Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck\r\nSounds something like. Better than farmer's beans\r\nTo a discriminating appetite,\r\nThough the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had\r\nIn bushel lots doesn't come on the market.\r\nBut, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all?\r\nYou're hiding something. That's as bad as lying.\r\nYou ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe\r\nWith a lawyer at hand to find you out.\r\nNothing is hidden from some people, Anne.\r\nYou don't tell me that where you found a Ram's\nHorn\r\nYou didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper.\r\nWhat did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would.\r\nDon't you defend yourself. If it was there,\r\nWhere is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?\"\n\r\n\"Well, wait it's common it's too common.\"\n\n\"Common?\r\nThe Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner.\"\n\r\n\"I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper\r\nTo You to you I mean they're both too\ncommon.\"\n\r\nThe lawyer gave a laugh among his papers\r\nAs if with some idea that she had scored.\n\r\n\"I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets.\r\nIt's not fair to the child. It can't be helped\nthough:\r\nPressed into service means pressed out of shape.\r\nSomehow I'll make it right with her she'll see.\r\nShe's going to do my scouting in the field,\r\nOver stone walls and all along a wood\r\nAnd by a river bank for water flowers,\r\nThe floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,\r\nAnd at the sinus under water a fist\r\nOf little fingers all kept down but one,\r\nAnd that thrust up to blossom in the sun\r\nAs if to say 'You! You're the Heart's desire.'\r\nAnne has a way with flowers to take the place\r\nOf that she's lost: she goes down on one knee\r\nAnd lifts their faces by the chin to hers\r\nAnd says their names, and leaves them where they\nare.\"\n\r\nThe lawyer wore a watch the case of which\r\nWas cunningly devised to make a noise\r\nLike a small pistol when he snapped it shut\r\nAt such a time as this. He snapped it now.\n\r\n\"Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait.\r\nThe lawyer man is thinking of his train.\r\nHe wants to give me lots and lots of money\r\nBefore he goes, because I hurt myself,\r\nAnd it may take him I don't know how long.\r\nBut put our flowers in water first. Will, help her:\r\nThe pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup?\r\nJust hook them on the inside of the pitcher.\r\nNow run. Get out your documents! You see\r\nI have to keep on the good side of Anne.\r\nI'm a great boy to think of number one.\r\nAnd you can't blame me in the place I'm in.\r\nWho will take care of my necessities\r\nUnless I do?\"\n\n\"A pretty interlude,\"\r\nThe lawyer said: \"I'm sorry, but my train  \r\nLuckily terms are all agreed upon.\r\nYou only have to sign your name. Right there.\"\n\r\n\"You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here\r\nWhere you can't make them. What is it you want?\r\nI'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go.\"\n\r\n\"You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?\"\n\r\n\"Make yourself useful then, and read it for me.\r\nIsn't it something I have seen before?\"\n\r\n\"You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it.\"\n\r\n\"Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much\r\nIn haste to get it over with as you.\r\nBut read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain:\r\nHalf the time I don't know what's troubling me. \r\nWhat do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool.\r\nYou! crumpling folkses' legal documents.\r\nOut with it if you've any real objection.\"\n\r\n\"Five hundred dollars!\"\n\n\"What would you think right?\"\n\r\n\"A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much;\r\nYou know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is\r\nAccepting anything before he knows\r\nWhether he's ever going to walk again.\r\nIt smells to me like a dishonest trick.\"\n\r\n\"I think I think from what I heard to-day \r\nAnd saw myself he would be ill-advised  \"\n\r\n\"What did you hear, for instance?\" Willis said.\n\r\n\"Now the place where the accident occurred  \"\n\r\nThe Broken One was twisted in his bed.\r\n\"This is between you two apparently.\r\nWhere I come in is what I want to know.\r\nYou stand up to it like a pair of cocks.\r\nGo outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me.\r\nWhen you come back, I'll have the papers signed.\r\nWill pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen.\r\nOne of you hold my head up from the pillow.\"\n\r\nWillis flung off the bed. \"I wash my hands \r\nI'm no match no, and don't pretend to be  \"\n\r\nThe lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.\r\n\"You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it.\r\nWe're very sorry for you.\"\n\nWillis sneered:\r\n\"Who's we? some stockholders in Boston?\r\nI'll go outdoors, by gad! and won't come back.\"\n\r\n\"Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come.\r\nYes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's\nsavage.\r\nHe thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.\r\nYou don't know what I mean about the flowers.\r\nDon't stop to try now. You'll miss your train.\r\nGood-bye.\" He flung his arms around his face."

Earth's the right place for love:\r\nI don't know where it's likely to go better.\r\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\r\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\r\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\r\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\r\nOne could do worse than be a swinger of birches."

Lunenburg.\"\r\nThen I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,\r\nBeyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,\r\nBut only felt at night its shadowy presence.\r\n\"Where is your village? Very far from here?\"\n\r\n\"There is no village only scattered farms.\r\nWe were but sixty voters last election.\r\nWe can't in nature grow to many more:\r\nThat thing takes all the room!\" He moved his goad.\r\nThe mountain stood there to be pointed at.\r\nPasture ran up the side a little way,\r\nAnd then there was a wall of trees with trunks:\r\nAfter that only tops of trees, and cliffs\r\nImperfectly concealed among the leaves.\r\nA dry ravine emerged from under boughs\r\nInto the pasture.\n\n\"That looks like a path.\r\nIs that the way to reach the top from here? \r\nNot for this morning, but some other time:\r\nI must be getting back to breakfast now.\"\n\r\n\"I don't advise your trying from this side.\r\nThere is no proper path, but those that have\r\nBeen up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's.\r\nThat's five miles back. You can't mistake the place:\r\nThey logged it there last winter some way up.\r\nI'd take you, but I'm bound the other way.\"\n\r\n\"You've never climbed it?\"\n\n\"I've been on the sides\r\nDeer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook\r\nThat starts up on it somewhere I've heard say\r\nRight on the top, tip-top a curious thing.\r\nBut what would interest you about the brook,\r\nIt's always cold in summer, warm in winter.\r\nOne of the great sights going is to see\r\nIt steam in winter like an ox's breath.\r\nUntil the bushes all along its banks\r\nAre inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles \r\nYou know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!\"\n\r\n\"There ought to be a view around the world\r\nFrom such a mountain if it isn't wooded\r\nClear to the top.\" I saw through leafy screens\r\nGreat granite terraces in sun and shadow,\r\nShelves one could rest a knee on getting up \r\nWith depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;\r\nOr turn and sit on and look out and down,\r\nWith little ferns in crevices at his elbow.v\r\n\r\n\"As to that I can't say. But there's the spring,\r\nRight on the summit, almost like a fountain.\r\nThat ought to be worth seeing.\"\n\n\"If it's there.\r\nYou never saw it?\"\n\n\"I guess there's no doubt\r\nAbout its being there. I never saw it.\r\nIt may not be right on the very top:\r\nIt wouldn't have to be a long way down\r\nTo have some head of water from above,\r\nAnd a good distance down might not be noticed\r\nBy anyone who'd come a long way up.\r\nOne time I asked a fellow climbing it\r\nTo look and tell me later how it was.\"\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He said there was a lake\r\nSomewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.\"\n\r\n\"But a lake's different. What about the spring?\"\n\r\n\"He never got up high enough to see.\r\nThat's why I don't advise your trying this side.\r\nHe tried this side. I've always meant to go\r\nAnd look myself, but you know how it is:\r\nIt doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain\r\nYou've worked around the foot of all your life.\r\nWhat would I do? Go in my overalls,\r\nWith a big stick, the same as when the cows\r\nHaven't come down to the bars at milking time?\r\nOr with a shotgun for a stray black bear?\r\n'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it.\"\n\r\n\"I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to \r\nNot for the sake of climbing. What's its name?\"\n\r\n\"We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right.\"\n\r\n\"Can one walk round it? Would it be too far?\"\n\r\n\"You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg,\r\nBut it's as much as ever you can do,\r\nThe boundary lines keep in so close to it.\r\nHor is the township, and the township's Hor \nAnd a few houses sprinkled round the foot,\r\nLike boulders broken off the upper cliff,\r\nRolled out a little farther than the rest.\"\n\r\n\"Warm in December, cold in June, you say?\"\n\r\n\"I don't suppose the waters changed at all.\r\nYou and I know enough to know it's warm\r\nCompared with cold, and cold compared with warm.\r\nBut all the fun's in how you say a thing.\"\n\r\n\"You've lived here all your life?\"\n\n\"Ever since Hor\n\r\nWas no bigger than a  \" What, I did not hear.\r\nHe drew the oxen toward him with light touches\r\nOf his slim goad on nose and offside flank,\r\nGave them their marching orders, and was moving."

That\nleaf!\r\nIt can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.\r\nBut the wind didn't move it if it moved.\r\nIt moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.\r\nIt couldn't stir so sensitively poised\r\nA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp\r\nTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame,\r\nOr blow a rumple in the collie's coat.\r\nYou make a little foursquare block of air,\r\nQuiet and light and warm, in spite of all\r\nThe illimitable dark and cold and storm,\r\nAnd by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,\r\nAnd book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;\r\nThough for all anyone can tell, repose\r\nMay be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.\r\nSo false it is that what we haven't we can't give;\r\nSo false, that what we always say is true.\r\nI'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.\r\nIt won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?\"\n\r\n\"I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,\r\nBut if you're going Say you'll stay, you know?\r\nBut let me raise this curtain on a scene,\r\nAnd show you how it's piling up against you.\r\nYou see the snow-white through the white of frost?\r\nAsk Helen how far up the sash it's climbed\r\nSince last we read the gage.\"\n\n\"It looks as if\r\nSome pallid thing had squashed its features flat\r\nAnd its eyes shut with overeagerness\r\nTo see what people found so interesting\r\nIn one another, and had gone to sleep\r\nOf its own stupid lack of understanding,\r\nOr broken its white neck of mushroom stuff\r\nShort off, and died against the window-pane.\"\n\r\n\"Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself\r\nMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.\r\nIt's you it matters to, because it's you\r\nWho have to go out into it alone.\"\n\r\n\"Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay.\"\n\r\n\"Before you drop the curtain I'm reminded:\r\nYou recollect the boy who came out here\r\nTo breathe the air one winter had a room\r\nDown at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning\r\nAfter a downy storm, he passed our place\r\nAnd found me banking up the house with snow.\r\nAnd I was burrowing in deep for warmth,\r\nPiling it well above the window-sills.\r\nThe snow against the window caught his eye.\r\n'Hey, that's a pretty thought' those were his\nwords.\r\n'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,\r\nWhile you sit warm and read up balanced rations.\r\nYou can't get too much winter in the winter.'\r\nThose were his words. And he went home and\nall\r\nBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.\r\nNow you and I would go to no such length.\r\nAt the same time you can't deny it makes\r\nIt not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,\r\nPlaying our fancy, to have the snowline run\r\nSo high across the pane outside. There where\r\nThere is a sort of tunnel in the frost\r\nMore like a tunnel than a hole way down\r\nAt the far end of it you see a stir\r\nAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the drift\r\nBlown in the wind. I like that I like that.\r\nWell, now I leave you, people.\"\n\n\"Come, Meserve,\r\nWe thought you were deciding not to go \r\nThe ways you found to say the praise of comfort\r\nAnd being where you are. You want to stay.\"\n\r\n\"I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.\r\nThis house is frozen brittle, all except\r\nThis room you sit in. If you think the wind\r\nSounds further off, it's not because it's dying;\r\nYou're further under in the snow that's all \r\nAnd feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust\r\nIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth,\r\nAnd at the eaves. I like it from inside\r\nMore than I shall out in it. But the horses\r\nAre rested and it's time to say good-night,\r\nAnd let you get to bed again. Good-night,\r\nSorry I had to break in on your sleep.\"\n\r\n\"Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you\r\nYou had us for a half-way station\r\nTo stop at. If you were the kind of man\r\nPaid heed to women, you'd take my advice\r\nAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.\r\nBut what good is my saying it over and over?\r\nYou've done more than you had a right to think\r\nYou could do now. You know the risk you take\r\nIn going on.\"\n\n\"Our snow-storms as a rule\r\nAren't looked on as man-killers, and although\r\nI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep\r\nUnder it all, his door sealed up and lost,\r\nThan the man fighting it to keep above it,\r\nYet think of the small birds at roost and not\r\nIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?\r\nTheir bulk in water would be frozen rock\r\nIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow\r\nThey will come budding boughs from tree to tree\r\nFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee,\r\nAs if not knowing what you meant by the word\nstorm.\"\n\r\n\"But why when no one wants you to go on?\r\nYour wife she doesn't want you to. We don't,\r\nAnd you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?\"\n\r\n\"Save us from being cornered by a woman.\r\nWell, there's\" She told Fred afterward that in\r\nThe pause right there, she thought the dreaded word\r\nWas coming, \"God.\" But no, he only said\r\n\"Well, there's the storm. That says I must go on.\r\nThat wants me as a war might if it came.\r\nAsk any man.\"\n\nHe threw her that as something\r\nTo last her till he got outside the door.\n\r\nHe had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.\r\nWhen Cole returned he found his wife still standing\r\nBeside the table near the open book,\r\nNot reading it.\n\n\"Well, what kind of a man\r\nDo you call that?\" she said.\n\n\"He had the gift\r\nOf words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?\"\n\r\n\"Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or disregarding peopled civil questions \r\nWhat? We've found out in one hour more about\nhim\r\nThan we had seeing him pass by in the road\r\nA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!\r\nYou didn't think you'd keep him after all.\r\nOh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you\r\nMuch say in the matter, and I'm just as glad\r\nWe're not in for a night of him. No sleep\r\nIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.\r\nIt's quiet as an empty church without him.\"\n\r\n\"But how much better off are we as it is?\r\nWe'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.\"\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.\r\nHe knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.\r\nGet into bed I say, and get some rest.\r\nHe won't come back, and if he telephones,\r\nIt won't be for an hour or two.\"\n\n\"Well then\r\nWe can't be any help by sitting here\r\nAnd living his fight through with him, I suppose.\nCole had been telephoning in the dark.\r\nMrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:\r\n\"Did she call you or you call her?\"\n\n\"She me.\r\nYou'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.\r\nWe must have been asleep: it's three and after.\"\n\r\n\"Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.\r\nI want to speak to her.\"\n\n\"All she said was,\r\nHe hadn't come and had he really started.\"\n\r\n\"She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.\n\r\n\"He had the shovel. Hell have made a fight.\"\n\r\n\"Why did I ever let him leave this house!\"\n\r\n\"Don't begin that. You did the best you could\r\nTo keep him though perhaps you didn't quite\r\nConceal a wish to see him show the spunk\r\nTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.\"\n\r\n\"Fred, after all I said! You shan't make out\r\nThat it was any way but what it was.\r\nDid she let on by any word she said\r\nShe didn't thank me?\"\n\n\"When I told her 'Gone,'\r\n'Well then,' she said, and 'Well then' like a\nthreat.\r\nAnd then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,\r\nWhy did you let him go'?\"\n\n\"Asked why we let him?\r\nYou let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.\r\nShe didn't dare to speak when he was here.\r\nTheir number's twenty-one? The thing won't\nwork.\r\nSomeone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.\r\nThe stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!\r\nIt's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and\ngone.\"\n\r\n\"Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!\"\n\n\"Hello, Hello.\"\n\r\n\"What do you hear?\"\n\n\"I hear an empty room \r\nYou know it sounds that way. And yes, I hear \r\nI think I hear a clock and windows rattling.\r\nNo step though. If she's there she's sitting down.\"\n\r\n\"Shout, she may hear you.\"\n\n\"Shouting is no good.\"\n\r\n\"Keep speaking then.\"\n\n\"Hello. Hello. Hello.\r\nYou don't suppose ? She wouldn't go out doors?\"\n\r\n\"I'm half afraid that's just what she might do.\"\n\r\n\"And leave the children?\"\n\n\"Wait and call again.\r\nYou can't hear whether she has left the door\r\nWide open and the wind's blown out the lamp\r\nAnd the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?\"\n\r\n\"One of two things, either she's gone to bed\r\nOr gone out doors.\"\n\n\"In which case both are lost.\r\nDo you know what she's like? Have you ever met\nher?\r\nIt's strange she doesn't want to speak to us.\"\n\n\"Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.\"\n\r\n\"A clock maybe.\"\n\n\"Don't you hear something else?\"\n\r\n\"Not talking.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I hear what is it?\"\n\r\n\"What do you say it is?\"\n\n\"A baby's crying!\r\nFrantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.\"\n\r\n\"Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,\r\nNot if she's there.\"\n\n\"What do you make of it?\"\n\r\n\"There's only one thing possible to make,\r\nThat is, assuming that she has gone out.\r\nOf course she hasn't though.\" They both sat down\r\nHelpless. \"There's nothing we can do till\nmorning.\"\n\r\n\"Fred, I shan't let you think of going out.\"\n\r\n\"Hold on.\" The double bell began to chirp.\r\nThey started up. Fred took the telephone.\r\n\"Hello, Meserve. You're there, then! And your\nwife?\n\r\nGood! Why I asked she didn't seem to answer.\r\nHe says she went to let him in the barn. \r\nWe're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.\r\nDrop in and see us when you're passing.\"\n\n\"Well.\r\nShe has him then, though what she wants him for\r\nI don't see.\"\n\n\"Possibly not for herself.\r\nMaybe she only wants him for the children.\"\n\r\n\"The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.\r\nWhat spoiled our night was to him just his fun.\r\nWhat did he come in for? To talk and visit?\r\nThought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.\r\nIf he thinks he is going to make our house\r\nA halfway coffee house 'twixt town and\nnowhere  \"\n\r\n\"I thought you'd feel you'd been too much\nconcerned.\"\n\r\n\"You think you haven't been concerned yourself.\"\n\r\n\"If you mean he was inconsiderate\r\nTo rout us out to think for him at midnight\r\nAnd then take our advice no more than nothing,\r\nWhy, I agree with you. But let's forgive him.\r\nWe've had a share in one night of his life.\r\nWhat'll you bet he ever calls again?\""

And it's scarce enough to call\r\nA view.\"\n\n\"And yet you think you like it, dear?\"\n\r\n\"That's what you're so concerned to know! You\r\nhope\r\nI like it. Bang goes something big away\r\nOff there upstairs. The very tread of men\r\nAs great as those is shattering to the frame\r\nOf such a little house. Once left alone,\r\nYou and I, dear, will go with softer steps\r\nUp and down stairs and through the rooms, and\r\nnone\r\nBut sudden winds that snatch them from our hands\r\nWill ever slam the doors.\"\n\n\"I think you see\r\nMore than you like to own to out that window.\"\n\r\n\"No; for besides the things I tell you of,\r\nI only see the years.

Watch this husky swarming up\r\nOver the wheel into the sky-high seat,\r\nLighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose\r\nAt the flame burning downward as he sucks it.\"\n\r\n\"See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof\r\nHow dark it's getting. Can you tell what time\r\nIt is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!\r\nWhat shoulder did I see her over? Neither.\r\nA wire she is of silver, as new as we\r\nTo everything. Her light won't last us long.\r\nIt's something, though, to know we're going to\nhave her\r\nNight after night and stronger every night\r\nTo see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,\r\nThe stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;\r\nAsk them to help you get it on its feet.\r\nWe stand here dreaming. Hurry!

And a light.\r\nHave we a piece of candle if the lamp\r\nAnd oil are buried out of reach?\"\n\nAgain\r\nThe house was full of tramping, and the dark,\r\nDoor-filling men burst in and seized the stove.\r\nA cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,\r\nTo which they set it true by eye; and then\r\nCame up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,\r\nSo much too light and airy for their strength\r\nIt almost seemed to come ballooning up,\r\nSlipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.\r\n\"A fit!\" said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder.\r\n\"It's good luck when you move in to begin\r\nWith good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,\r\nIt's not so bad in the country, settled down,\r\nWhen people 're getting on in life. You'll like it.\"\r\nJoe said: \"You big boys ought to find a farm,\r\nAnd make good farmers, and leave other fellows\r\nThe city work to do. There's not enough\r\nFor everybody as it is in there.\"\r\n\"God!\" one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:\r\n\"Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.\"\r\nBut Jimmy only made his jaw recede\r\nFool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say\r\nHe saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French\nboy\r\nWho said with seriousness that made them laugh,\r\n\"Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask.\"\r\nHe doffed his cap and held it with both hands\r\nAcross his chest to make as 'twere a bow:\r\n\"We're giving you our chances on de farm.\"\r\nAnd then they all turned to with deafening boots\r\nAnd put each other bodily out of the house.\r\n\"Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think \r\nI don't know what they think we see in what\r\nThey leave us to: that pasture slope that seems\r\nThe back some farm presents us; and your woods\r\nTo northward from your window at the sink,\r\nWaiting to steal a step on us whenever\r\nWe drop our eyes or turn to other things,\r\nAs in the game 'Ten-step' the children play.\"\n\r\n\"Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city.\r\nAll they could say was 'God!' when you proposed\r\nTheir coming out and making useful farmers.\"\n\r\n\"Did they make something lonesome go through\nyou?\r\nIt would take more than them to sicken you \r\nUs of our bargain. But they left us so\r\nAs to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.\r\nThey almost shook me.\"\n\n\"It's all so much\r\nWhat we have always wanted, I confess\r\nIt's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem\r\nEven worse still, and so on down, down, down.\r\nIt's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.\r\nI never bore it well when people went.\r\nThe first night after guests have gone, the house\r\nSeems haunted or exposed. I always take\r\nA personal interest in the locking up\r\nAt bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.\"\r\nHe fetched a dingy lantern from behind\r\nA door. \"There's that we didn't lose! And these!\"\r\nSome matches he unpocketed. \"For food \r\nThe meals we've had no one can take from us.\r\nI wish that everything on earth were just\r\nAs certain as the meals we've had. I wish\r\nThe meals we haven't had were, anyway.\r\nWhat have you you know where to lay your hands\non?\"\n\r\n\"The bread we bought in passing at the store.\r\nThere's butter somewhere, too.\"\n\n\"Let's rend the bread.\r\nI'll light the fire for company for you;\r\nYou'll not have any other company\r\nTill Ed begins to get out on a Sunday\r\nTo look us over and give us his idea\r\nOf what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up.\r\nHe'll know what he would do if he were we,\r\nAnd all at once. He'll plan for us and plan\r\nTo help us, but he'll take it out in planning.\r\nWell, you can set the table with the loaf.\r\nLet's see you find your loaf. I'll light the fire.\r\nI like chairs occupying other chairs\r\nNot offering a lady \"\n\n\"There again, Joe!\nYou're tired.\"\n\n\"I'm drunk-nonsensical tired out;\r\nDon't mind a word I say. It's a day's work\r\nTo empty one house of all household goods\r\nAnd fill another with 'em fifteen miles away,\r\nAlthough you do no more than dump them down.\"\n\r\n\"Dumped down in paradise we are and happy.\"\n\r\n\"It's all so much what I have always wanted,\r\nI can't believe it's what you wanted, too.\"\n\r\n\"Shouldn't you like to know?\"\n\n\"I'd like to know\r\nIf it is what you wanted, then how much\r\nYou wanted it for me.\"\n\n\"A troubled conscience!\r\nYou don't want me to tell if I don't know.\"\n\r\n\"I don't want to find out what can't be known.\r\nBut who first said the word to come?\"\n\n\"My dear,\r\nIt's who first thought the thought. You're\r\nsearching, Joe,\r\nFor things that don't exist; I mean beginnings.\r\nEnds and beginnings there are no such things.\r\nThere are only middles.\"\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"This life?\r\nOur sitting here by lantern-light together\r\nAmid the wreckage of a former home?\r\nYou won't deny the lantern isn't new.\r\nThe stove is not, and you are not to me,\r\nNor I to you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you never were?\"\n\r\n\"It would take me forever to recite\r\nAll that's not new in where we find ourselves.\r\nNew is a word for fools in towns who think\r\nStyle upon style in dress and thought at last\r\nMust get somewhere. I've heard you say as much.\r\nNo, this is no beginning.\"\n\n\"Then an end?\"\n\r\n\"End is a gloomy word.\"\n\n\"Is it too late\r\nTo drag you out for just a good-night call\r\nOn the old peach trees on the knoll to grope\r\nBy starlight in the grass for a last peach\r\nThe neighbors may not have taken as their right\r\nWhen the house wasn't lived in? I've been looking:\r\nI doubt if they have left us many grapes.\r\nBefore we set ourselves to right the house,\r\nThe first thing in the morning, out we go\r\nTo go the round of apple, cherry, peach,\r\nPine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook.\r\nAll of a farm it is.\"\n\n\"I know this much:\r\nI'm going to put you in your bed, if first\r\nI have to make you build it. Come, the light.\"\n\r\nWhen there was no more lantern in the kitchen,\r\nThe fire got out through crannies in the stove\r\nAnd danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,\r\nAs much at home as if they'd always danced there."

But James is one big fool.\r\nHe thought you meant to find fault with his work.\r\nThat's what the average farmer would have meant.\r\nJames would take time, of course, to chew it over\r\nBefore he acted: he's just got round to act.\"\n\r\n\"He is a fool if that's the way he takes me.\"\n\r\n\"Don't let it bother you. You've found out\nsomething.\r\nThe hand that knows his business won't be told\r\nTo do work better or faster those two things.\r\nI'm as particular as anyone:\r\nMost likely I'd have served you just the same.\r\nBut I know you don't understand our ways.\r\nYou were just talking what was in your mind,\r\nWhat was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting.\n\r\nTell you a story of what happened once:\r\nI was up here in Salem at a man's\r\nNamed Sanders with a gang of four or five\r\nDoing the haying. No one liked the boss.\r\nHe was one of the kind sports call a spider,\r\nAll wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy\r\nFrom a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.\r\nBut work! that man could work, especially\r\nIf by so doing he could get more work,\r\nOut of his hired help. I'm not denying\r\nHe was hard on himself. I couldn't find\r\nThat he kept any hours not for himself.\r\nDaylight and lantern-light were one to him:\r\nI've heard him pounding in the barn all night.\r\nBut what he liked was someone to encourage.\r\nThem that he couldn't lead he'd get behind\r\nAnd drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing \r\nKeep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs\noff.\r\nI'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks\r\n(We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.\r\nSo when he paired off with me in the hayfield\r\nTo load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.\r\nI built the load and topped it off; old Sanders\r\nCombed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.'\r\nEverything went well till we reached the barn\r\nWith a big jag to empty in a bay.\r\nYou understand that meant the easy job\r\nFor the man up on top of throwing down\r\nThe hay and rolling it off wholesale,\r\nWhere on a mow it would have been slow lifting.\r\nYou wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging\r\nUnder those circumstances, would you now?\r\nBut the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,\r\nAnd looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,\r\nShouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!\r\nThinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you\nsaid?'\r\nI asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,\r\n'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.'\r\nHe said it over, but he said it softer.\r\nNever you say a thing like that to a man,\r\nNot if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon\r\nMurdered him as left out his middle name.\r\nI'd built the load and knew right where to find it.\r\nTwo or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for\r\nLike meditating, and then I just dug in\r\nAnd dumped the rackful on him in ten lots,\r\nI looked over the side once in the dust\r\nAnd caught sight of him treading-water-like,\r\nKeeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says,\r\n'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.\r\nThat was the last I saw or heard of him.\r\nI cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.\r\nAs I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,\r\nAnd sort of waiting to be asked about it,\r\nOne of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?'\r\n'I left him in the barn under the hay.\r\nIf ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.'\r\nThey realised from the way I swobbed my neck\r\nMore than was needed something must be up.\r\nThey headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.\r\nThey told me afterward. First they forked hay,\r\nA lot of it, out into the barn floor.\r\nNothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.\r\nI guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple\r\nBefore I buried him, or I couldn't have managed.\r\nThey excavated more. 'Go keep his wife\r\nOut of the barn.' Someone looked in a window,\r\nAnd curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen\r\nSlumped way down in a chair, with both his feet\r\nStuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.\r\nHe looked so clean disgusted from behind\r\nThere was no one that dared to stir him up,\r\nOr let him know that he was being looked at.\r\nApparently I hadn't buried him\r\n(I may have knocked him down); but my just\ntrying\r\nTo bury him had hurt his dignity.\r\nHe had gone to the house so's not to meet me.\r\nHe kept away from us all afternoon.\r\nWe tended to his hay. We saw him out\r\nAfter a while picking peas in his garden:\r\nHe couldn't keep away from doing something.\"\n\r\n\"Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?\"\n\r\n\"No! and yet I don't know it's hard to say.\r\nI went about to kill him fair enough.\"\n\r\n\"You took an awkward way. Did he discharge\nyou?\"\r\n\"Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right.\""

There's nobody about.\r\nThe chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk\nsmoking.\r\nAnd I lie back and ride. I take the reins\r\nOnly when someone's coming, and the mare\r\nStops when she likes: I tell her when to go.\r\nI've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.\r\nShe's got so she turns in at every house\r\nAs if she had some sort of curvature,\r\nNo matter if I have no errand there.\r\nShe thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am.\r\nIt's seldom I get down except for meals, though.\r\nFolks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,\r\nAll in a family row down to the youngest.\"\n\r\n\"One would suppose they might not be as glad\r\nTo see you as you are to see them.\"\n\n\"Oh,\r\nBecause I want their dollar. I don't want\r\nAnything they've not got. I never dun.\r\nI'm there, and they can pay me if they like.\r\nI go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.\r\nSorry there is no cup to give you a drink.\r\nI drink out of the bottle not your style.\r\nMayn't I offer you  ?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, thank you.\n\r\n\"Just as you say. Here's looking at you then. \r\nAnd now I'm leaving you a little while.\n\r\nYou'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps \r\nLie down let yourself go and get some sleep.\r\nBut first let's see what was I going to ask you?\r\nThose collars who shall I address them to,\r\nSuppose you aren't awake when I come back?\"\n\r\n\"Really, friend, I can't let you. You may need\nthem.\"\n\r\n\"Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style.\"\n\r\n\"But really I have so many collars.\"\n\r\n\"I don't know who I rather would have have them.\r\nThey're only turning yellow where they are.\r\nBut you're the doctor as the saying is.\r\nI'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me:\r\nI've just begun the night. You get some sleep.\r\nI'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door\r\nWhen I come back so you'll know who it is.\r\nThere's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.\r\nI don't want you should shoot me in the head.\r\nWhat am I doing carrying off this bottle?\r\nThere now, you get some sleep.\"\n\nHe shut the door\r\nThe Doctor slid a little down the pillow."

The rascal, he said he'd be glad\r\nTo tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.\r\nThere had been some berries but those were all\ngone.\r\nHe didn't say where they had been. He went on:\r\n'I'm sure I'm sure' as polite as could be.\r\nHe spoke to his wife in the door, 'Let me see,\r\nMarne, we don't know any good berrying place?'\r\nIt was all he could do to keep a straight face.\"\n\r\n\"If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,\r\nHe'll find he's mistaken. See here, for a whim,\r\nWe'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.\r\nWe'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear,\r\nAnd the sun shines out warm: the vines must be\nwet.\r\nIt's so long since I picked I almost forget\r\nHow we used to pick berries: we took one look\nround,\r\nThen sank out of sight like trolls underground,\r\nAnd saw nothing more of each other, or heard,\r\nUnless when you said I was keeping a bird\r\nAway from its nest, and I said it was you.\r\n'Well, one of us is.' For complaining it flew\r\nAround and around us. And then for a while\r\nWe picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile,\r\nAnd I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout\r\nToo loud for the distance you were, it turned out,\r\nFor when you made answer, your voice was as low\r\nAs talking you stood up beside me, you know.\"\n\r\n\"We shan't have the place to ourselves to enjoy \r\nNot likely, when all the young Lorens deploy.\r\nThey'll be there to-morrow, or even to-night.\r\nThey won't be too friendly they may be polite \r\nTo people they look on as having no right\r\nTo pick where they're picking. But we won't\ncomplain.\r\nYou ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,\r\nThe fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,\r\nLike two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves.\""
